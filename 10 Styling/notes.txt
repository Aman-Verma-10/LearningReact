npm init -y
npm install -D parcel
npm install react react-dom
## some changes on package.json
npx parcel index.html ## parcel goes to index.html(src point) and build a development build and host that development build on localhost:port
## npx means executing a package

In package.json do : script { "start": "parcel index.html"}

install react instead of using CDN links to avoid netowrk calls

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
normal JS don't have import so by using type="module" telling browser that it is not a normal JS as we are using module for import export for files

npx parcel build index.html(for production build) : remove "main": "index.js/App.js" from package.json

dist contains dev or production build code
.parcel-cache and dist also get automatically generated so put them in .gitignore

## Config driven UI
- Different data based on different location
- Website is driven by data|configs
- Controlling your UI how the UI looks like using data, using the config i.e. data coming from backend

# Parent-child relationship(class based life cycle)
- Parent Constructor
- Parent Render
- Child Constructor
- Child Render
- Child Component did mount
- Parent Component did mount

# Incase of multiple childrens
- Parent Constructor
- Parent Render
- First(class)Child Constructor
- First(class)Child Render
- second(class)Child Constructor
- second(class)Child Render
- First(class)Child Component did mount
- second(class)Child Component did mount
- Parent Component did mount

Note:  : React do "optimization" and batches both the childs together so first render get called then commit phase executed all together for both the batched child. Batching render phase then commit phase. Commit phase takes time(It is expensive because DOM manipulation is expensive) that's why react tries to batch up tasks before updating the DOM

Two phases in lifecycle:
- Render Phase: constructor, Render
- Commit phase: React updates DOM and refs, componentDidMount. Commit phase takes 

# Single Responsibility Principle
- reusable code
- maintanable
- testable
