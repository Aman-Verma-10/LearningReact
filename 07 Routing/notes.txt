npx parcel index.html ## parcel goes to index.html(src point) and build a development build and host that development build on localhost:port
## npx means executing a package

In package.json do : script { "start": "parcel index.html"}

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
normal JS don't have import so by using type="module" telling browser that it is not a normal JS as we are using module for import export for files

npx parcel build index.html(for production build) : remove "main": "index.js/App.js" from package.json

dist contains dev or production build code
.parcel-cache and dist also get automatically generated so put them in .gitignore
